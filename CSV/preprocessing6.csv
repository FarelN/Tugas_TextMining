1.0,"Used to be the best McDonald's outlet in town, but recently the waiting time can be as long as 30 mins both in the drive thru and restaurant. Plenty of Gojek waiting for orders should have given the management clues how long wait time is. We used to love this outlet. Clean and good service. I dont know what happened here, different manager maybe?"
2.0,"3 separate occasions, I bought fries for my son, and they gave me limp old fries, salty coz it's been out long, in other words 'not fresh'. Please maintain quality, as I have to buy a fresh one from Burger King for my son"
